    This is effectively the delay for the samples rendered at the the device's current clock time from reaching the physical output.

  summary: >-
    Expects a destination size of 2, and provides both the audio device clock time and latency, both in nanoseconds.

    The two values are measured atomically with respect to one another (i.e. the latency value was measured at the same time the device clock value was retrieved).

    NULL is an invalid device.

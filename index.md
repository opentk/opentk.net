### Introduction

The Open Toolkit is set of fast, low-level C# bindings for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research.

OpenTK provides several utility libraries, including a math/linear algebra package, a windowing system, and input handling.

### Developer decisions

OpenTK is not a game engine, nor does it try to be one. It offers a useful set of libraries, and leaves it up to the developer to make the decisions on how to use them.

It is the ideal starting point if you want to write a game or scientific application from the ground up.

### Project Status (16/01/2017)

You can download it here:

[OpenTK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK/)

[OpenTK.GLControl](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenTK.GLControl/)

We are currently working towards an official release package.

If you wish to install from your IDE or the command line, you'll need to
enable a 'show pre-releases' flag to see the package. To do this, tick the
'Include prerelease' in Visual Studio, or use -IncludePrerelease from the
NuGet CLI.

If you encounter any issues, please let us know with a GitHub issue.

# LearnOpenTK
Welcome to LearnOpenTK, your home for getting started with OpenTK. We've ported the tutorials made by the great guys over at [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) over to C# so that it's easier for you to see how OpenTK works.

## OpenTK 4

The tutorials hosted on this website have tabs to switch between OpenTK 3 and OpenTK 4 code snippets.
There is also a repository on GitHub that contains tutorials using OpenTK 4 here:

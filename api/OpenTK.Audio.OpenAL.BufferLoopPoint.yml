  summary: >-
    <p>

    Specifies the two offsets the playing source will use to loop, expressed

    in uncompressed samples. This only has an affect when the source it's

    attached to is of an AL_STATIC type and its AL_LOOPING attribute is set to

    AL_TRUE. The first value specifies the offset the source will loop to when

    it reaches the offset specified by the second value.

    </p>

    <p>

    If the source's current position within the buffer is not between the two

    offsets, it will not be moved. If the source then reaches the end of the

    buffer data, it will progress to an AL_STOPPED state.

    </p>

    <p>

    The offsets must be less than or equal to the number of samples in the

    buffer, and the second offset must be greater than the first offset, or an

    AL_INVALID_VALUE error is generated. An attempt to change the values while

    the buffer is attached or queued to a source will generate an

    AL_INVALID_OPERATION error.

### Introduction

The Open Toolkit is set of fast, low-level C# bindings for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research.

OpenTK provides several utility libraries, including a math/linear algebra package, a windowing system, and input handling.

### Developer decisions

OpenTK is not a game engine, nor does it try to be one. It offers a useful set of libraries, and leaves it up to the developer to make the decisions on how to use them.

It is the ideal starting point if you want to write a game or scientific application from the ground up.

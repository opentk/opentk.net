  summary: >-
    AL_SEC_OFFSET_LATENCY_SOFT

    <br />

    The playback position, along with the device clock, both expressed in seconds.

    This attribute is read-only.

    <br />

    The first value in the returned vector is the offset in seconds.

    The value is similar to that returned by <xref href="OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL.ALSourcef.SecOffset" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>, just with more precision.

    <br />

    The second value is the device clock, in seconds.

    This updates at the same rate as the offset, and both are measured atomically with respect to one another.

    Be aware that this value may be subtly different from the other device clock queries due to the variable precision of floating-point values.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: SecOffsetClock = 4611
    return:
      type: OpenTK.Audio.OpenAL.SourceDouble
